ACM MMSec) was initiated in 1998 and focused on data hiding, robust/perceptual hash, biometrics, video surveillance, and multimedia forensics. Key seminal works have been published in these two workshops and papers accepted for publication there attracted over 9,000 citations in total. Year after year, the two communities grew closer and the overlap between their respective scope got bigger.

    "Systems, Programming, and Applications": {
        "description": "SPLASH's mission is to engage software innovators from all walks of life -- developers, academics and undeclared -- in conversations about bettering software. Bettering software involves new ideas about programming languages, tools, conceptual models, and methodologies that can cope with, evolve, and leverage, the complex software-intensive socio-technical system of systems that has emerged in front of our eyes during the past decades. Bettering software requires a deep understanding of the nature of these systems, an understanding that rides on the trends of the moment, but that goes well beyond. These are the topics of SPLASH.\n\n\nSPLASH has three general tracks: OOPSLA, Onward! and Wavefront.\n\n\nOOPSLA -- High quality research work that uses established scientific methodologies, written using high standards of academic technical publications.\n\n\nOnward! -- Innovative ideas that challenge existing beliefs, or early work well written and well argued for."

    "Spatial User Interaction": {
        "description": "The ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction (SUI) is the first international symposium focused on the user interface challenges that appear when users interact in the space where the flat, two-dimensional, digital world meets the volumetric, physical, three-dimensional (3D) space we live in. This considers both spatial input and 3D output, with an emphasis on the issues around interaction between humans and systems.\n\nDue to the advances in 3D technologies, spatial interaction is now more relevant than ever. Powerful graphics engines and high-resolution screens are now ubiquitous in everyday devices, such as tablets and mobile phones. Moreover, new forms of input, such as multi-touch, finger and body tracking technologies are now easily available. In this environment, spatial UIs are transitioning out of the research community and game industry. More and more commercial 3D systems with spatial interaction capabilities exist, many priced at the consumer level. Until now, the"
