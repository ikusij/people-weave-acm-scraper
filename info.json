ASPLOS provides a high quality forum for scientists and engineers to present their latest research findings in these rapidly changing fields. It has captured some of the major computer systems innovations of the past two decades (e.g., RISC and VLIW processors, small and large-scale multiprocessors, clusters and networks-of-workstations, optimizing compilers, RAID, and network-storage system designs).\n\n\nThis conference occurs at a time when computer architecture is facing great challenges, due both to the end of single-processor performance scaling and to new demands imposed by mobile and gigascale computing. Multi-disciplinary research is increasingly important as boundaries between hardware/software and local/network computing blur, as the form and capabilities of computing devices beco",

        "description": "With rapid global penetration of the Internet and smart phones and the resulting productivity and social gains, the world is becoming increasingly dependent on its cyber infrastructure. Criminals, spies and predators of all kinds have learnt to exploit this landscape much quicker than defenders have advanced in their technologies. Security and Privacy has become an essential concern of applications and systems throughout their lifecycle. Security concerns have rapidly moved up the software stack as the Internet and web have matured. The security, privacy, functionality, cost and usability tradeoffs necessary in any practical system can only be effectively achieved at the data and application layers. This new conference provides a dedicated venue for high-quality research in this arena, and seeks to foster a community with this focus in cyber security.",

From an educational perspective, programs are attempting to increase student enrollments despite dwindling funding and the recent economics crisis (enrollment and funding gaps). From an IT profession perspective, organizations continue to struggle to adequately manage their talent, provide career development and plan for succession as the baby boomers begin to retire (recruitment and retention gaps).

        "description": "Event-based systems are rapidly gaining importance in many application domains ranging from real time monitoring systems in production, logistics and networking to complex event processing in finance and security. The event based paradigm has gathered momentum as witnessed by current efforts in areas including publish/subscribe systems, event-driven architectures, complex event processing, business process management and modelling, Grid computing, Web services notifications, information dissemination, event stream processing, and message-oriented middleware. The various communities dealing with event based systems have made progress in different aspects of the problem. The DEBS conference attempts to bring together researchers and practitioners active in the various sub communities to share their views and reach a common understanding.",

It has a strong focus on systems research and development: operating systems, data base systems, real-time systems and middleware for networked, distributed, parallel, or embedded computing systems. As a highly recognized conference, EuroSys has become a premier forum for discussing various issues of systems software research and development, including implications related to hardware and applications.\n\n\nFuture EuroSys conferences will follow the pattern established by the previous EuroSys conferences, by seeking papers on all aspects of computer systems. EuroSys conferences will also include a number of workshops to allow junior and senior members of the systems community to explore leading-edge topics and ideas before they are presented at a conference.",

In future years, robots may become caretaking assistants for the elderly, or academic tutors for our children, or medical assistants, day care assistants, or psychological counsellors. Robots may become our co-workers in factories and offices, or maids in our homes. They may become our friends. As we move to create our future with robots, hard problems in human-robot interaction (HRI) exist, both technically and socially. The Fifth Annual Conference on HRI seeks to take up grand technical and social challenges in the field - and speak to their integration. HRI is a single-track, highly selective annual conference that seeks to showcase the very best research in human-robot interaction with roots in robotics, psychology, cognitive science, HCI, human factors, artificial intelligence, organizational behavior, anthropology, and many other fields. We invite broad participation.",

As computation becomes ubiquitous in our world, understanding of computing in order to design, structure, maintain, and utilize these technologies becomes increasingly important--both for the technology professional, but also for the technologically literate citizen. The research study of how the understanding of computation develops, and how to improve that understanding, is critically important for the technology-dependent societies in which we live.\n\n\nLearning: Computing education is naturally concerned with how students make sense of computational processes and devices in formal education, including primary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions. Computing education also goes beyond formal education. What do adults understand about computation, and how do they come to that understanding? What do chil",

ICPE is an annual conference that originated from the merger of the ACM Workshop on Software and Performance (WOSP) with the SPEC International Performance Engineering Workshop (SIPEW) in 2010. Nowadays, complex systems of all types, like Web-based systems, data centers and cloud infrastructures, social networks, peer-to-peer, mobile and wireless systems, cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, real-time and embedded systems, have increasingly distributed and dynamic system architectures that provide high flexibility, however, also increase the complexity of managing end-to-end application performance.\n\n\n\nICPE brings together researchers and industry practitioners to share and present their experiences, discuss challenges, and report",

IH) was created in 1996 and focused on digital watermarking, steganography and steganalysis, anonymity and privacy, hard to intercept communications and covert/subliminal channels. On the other hand, the ACM Workshop on Multimedia and Security (aka. ACM MMSec) was initiated in 1998 and focused on data hiding, robust/perceptual hash, biometrics, video surveillance, and multimedia forensics. Key seminal works have been published in these two workshops and papers accepted for publication there attracted over 9,000 citations in total. Year after year, the two communities grew closer and the overlap between their respective scope got bigger. As a result, after 14 successful editions each, IH and ACM MMSec decided to merge in a single event in an attempt to establish synergies between the two communities while building on the reputation obtained over the",

The aim is that papers presented at the conference contribute to the current understanding of how to collect or analyze Internet measurements, or give insight into how the Internet behaves.\n\n\nIMC was begun as a workshop in 2001 in response to the difficulty at that time finding appropriate publication/presentation venues for high-quality Internet measurement research. \n\n\nThe conference is generally held in late October or early November. In its first two years as a Workshop, attendance was limited, but now as a conference it is open to all interested in attending.\n\n\nPapers are submitted in May with notifications in July and camera-ready papers due in August. The acceptance rate to date has been around 25%. IMC is usually open to both full-length papers and extended abstracts,",

        "description": "n March 1988, a group of researchers gathered in Monterey, California to participate in a workshop titled: \"Architectures for Intelligent Interfaces\". It was the beginning of what at first would be a slow but steady development of the field of Intelligent User Interfaces. Three years later, the book \"Intelligent User Interfaces\" was published edited by Joe Sullivan and Sherman Tyler, the organizers of the workshop. The book highlighted the main papers presented in the workshop and served as a basis for not only future work, but also future events that continued that work. It was not until 1993, however, that Bill Hefley organized the First International Workshop on Intelligent User Interfaces, which took place in Orlando, Florida. The event, sponsored by ACM, attracted a nascent group of researchers whose work clearly defined the field as a novel and promising intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction.",

JCDL encompasses the many meanings of the term \"digital libraries,\" including (but not limited to) new forms of information institutions; operational information systems with all manner of digital content; new means of selecting, collecting, organizing, and distributing digital content; and theoretical models of information media, including document genres and electronic publishing. Digital libraries may be viewed as a new form of information institution or as an extension of the services libraries currently provide. Representatives from academe, government, industry, and others are invited to participate in this annual conference. The conference draws from a broad array of disciplines including computer science, information science, librarianship, archival science and practice, museum studies and practice",

Modern technologies not only are themselves knowledge-intensive technologies, but also produce enormous amounts of new information that we must process and aggregate. These technologies require knowledge capture, which involve the extraction of useful knowledge from vast and diverse sources of information as well as its acquisition directly from users. Driven by the demands for knowledge-based applications and the unprecedented availability of information on the Web, the study of knowledge capture has a renewed importance.\n\n\nResearchers that work in the area of knowledge capture traditionally belong to several distinct research communities, including knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence and the Semantic Web. K-CAP provides a forum that brings together members of disparate research com",

        "description": "Motion plays a crucial role in interactive applications, such as VR, AR, and video games. Characters move around, objects are manipulated or move due to physical constraints, entities are animated, and the camera moves through the scene. Motion is currently studied in many different research areas, including graphics and animation, game technology, robotics, simulation, computer vision, and also physics, psychology, and urban studies. Cross-fertilization between these communities can considerably advance the state-of-the-art in the area. The goal of the Motion, Interaction and Games conference is to bring together researchers from this variety of fields to present their most recent results, to initiate collaborations, and to contribute to the establishment of the research area.",

        "description": "The international NPAR symposium is dedicated to non-photorealistic animation and rendering. The symposium is sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH and is held in cooperation with Eurographics.\n\n\nNon-photorealistic animation and rendering (NPAR) refers to computational techniques for visual communication. Such techniques usually generate imagery and motion which is expressive, rather than photorealistic, although they may incorporate realistic elements. Researchers, artists, and practitioners of all areas connected to non-photorealistic animation and rendering are invited to submit papers and posters on their work. The three categories of submissions are: Research (including new algorithms, scientific studies, analysis, and data); Production (including candid discussions of the process of creating a work or art tool); Meta (including statements about research that do not contain new results, e.g., grand challenges, position papers, evaluation standards, surveys, and primers on art/aest",

Since 1991, PODS has been held jointly with the SIGMOD conference, combining the full spectrum of database research, from the most abstract and fundamental to the most pragmatic. A single registration gives attendees access to both PODS and SIGMOD sessions and copies of both proceedings.\n          \n          PODS papers are distinguished by a rigorous approach to widely diverse problems in databases, often bringing to bear techniques from such fields as computational logic, finite model theory, complexity theory, algorithm and data structure design and analysis, and many others.",

SIG members often refer to this Symposium as \"SIGCSE\". As in \"Are you going to SIGCSE?\" or \"I attended her talk at last year's SIGCSE\".\n\nThe SIGCSE Technical Symposium addresses problems common among educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate computing programs, curricula, and courses. The symposium provides a forum for sharing new ideas for syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of instruction. The symposium provides a diverse selection of technical sessions and opportunities for learning and interaction. If you have never been to one, do yourself a favor and go. You will not regret it!",

        "description": "SPLASH's mission is to engage software innovators from all walks of life -- developers, academics and undeclared -- in conversations about bettering software. Bettering software involves new ideas about programming languages, tools, conceptual models, and methodologies that can cope with, evolve, and leverage, the complex software-intensive socio-technical system of systems that has emerged in front of our eyes during the past decades. Bettering software requires a deep understanding of the nature of these systems, an understanding that rides on the trends of the moment, but that goes well beyond. These are the topics of SPLASH.\n\n\nSPLASH has three general tracks: OOPSLA, Onward! and Wavefront.\n\n\nOOPSLA -- High quality research work that uses established scientific methodologies, written using high standards of academic technical publications.\n\n\nOnward! -- Innovative ideas that challenge existing beliefs, or early work well written and well argued for.",

This considers both spatial input and 3D output, with an emphasis on the issues around interaction between humans and systems.\n\nDue to the advances in 3D technologies, spatial interaction is now more relevant than ever. Powerful graphics engines and high-resolution screens are now ubiquitous in everyday devices, such as tablets and mobile phones. Moreover, new forms of input, such as multi-touch, finger and body tracking technologies are now easily available. In this environment, spatial UIs are transitioning out of the research community and game industry. More and more commercial 3D systems with spatial interaction capabilities exist, many priced at the consumer level. Until now, the",

It constitutes a key aspect in a wide range of environments, from small mobile computing devices to large-scale data centers and computational clouds. Virtualization techniques are used across all layers of the software stack down to the microarchitectural level, encompassing the underlying hardware, the operating system, and the runtime system. While the approaches at different layers can differ dramatically, they tend to have similarities, and they must often tackle related challenges. The ACM SIGPLAN/SIGOPS International Conference on Virtual Execution Environments (VEE) brings together researchers and practitioners from different computer systems domains to interact and share ideas in order to advance the state of the art of virtualization and to broaden its applicability.",
